standard is a singleton it stores it as a dictionary so you need a key and a value.
object(which is generic and is of type ANY)
object(forKey:)is asking for the key part of the dictionary and once you access the key the value comes with it

the part that saves is UserDefaults.standard.set( forKey: "NameKey") it saves it as a dictionary

to get the SAVED information we use UserDefaults.standard.object("yulia", forKey: "NameKey") it tries to find the value and it is optional(may or may not have it) you can use nil coalescence

Another way is
if let someName = UserDefaults.standard.object(forKey: "NameKey")

it is the same syntax as below because it is a dictionary
let dict = ["Country":"Sweden"]
if let country = dict["Sweden"] {

}

Do not use value at all unless you have a clear understanding of dictionary Key and value
